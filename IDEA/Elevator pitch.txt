Introducing the Water Wastage Alarm System — a smart, low-cost solution for Indian households to prevent overhead tank overflows. Using an ultrasonic sensor, this system monitors the water level in real-time, activating an alarm when the tank is full. The system displays the water level on an OLED screen, signals warnings with LED indicators, and can even send SMS alerts via the SIM800L module. Not only does it save water and reduce energy bills, but it’s also affordable, easy to install, and perfect for promoting water conservation in every home. A practical and sustainable solution powered by the H2S-Dev board!
